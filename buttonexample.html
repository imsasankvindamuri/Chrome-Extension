                <h3>
                    Prepare the Dough:
                </h3>
                In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy.
                In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil, mixing until a dough forms.
                Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
                Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.

                <h3>
                    Preheat the Oven:
                </h3>
                Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    Assemble the Pizza:
                </h3>
                Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with flour.
                Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough.
                Add slices of fresh mozzarella evenly over the sauce.
                Drizzle olive oil over the top and season with a pinch of salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>
                    Bake the Pizza:
                </h3>
                If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the stone. Otherwise, place the baking sheet in the oven.
                Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.

                    Finish and Serve:
                </h3>
                Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly. Add fresh basil leaves before serving.
                Slice and enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!
